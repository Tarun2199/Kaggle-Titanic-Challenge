# Make your first Kaggle submission!

The Jupyter notebook goes through the Kaggle Titanic dataset via an exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python and finishes with making a submission.

If you're interested in hearing the topics covered in the code explained, I went through the notebook in a recent livestream on my YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/f1y9wDDxWnA

You can download the data from this repo or [directly from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

If you find any bugs, or make any improvements on the results in the notebook, I'd love to hear. 

Email me anytime: daniel@mrdbourke.com

Stay tuned for a blog post detailing the steps taken in the notebook soon.
